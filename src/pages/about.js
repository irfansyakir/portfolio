          <p>
            Hello! I'm Irfan Syakir, a soon-to-be graduate from Nanyang Technological University 
            with a Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering and Media. I'm passionate about
            creating efficient, user-friendly applications and implementing effective automation solutions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            My journey in software development began during my time at Singapore Polytechnic, 
            where I discovered my passion for programming and software development. Since then, I've developed a diverse
            skill set spanning full-stack development, mobile applications, and DevOps practices.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, having completed 
            several projects in computer vision, large language models, and predictive analytics. 
            My AI/ML focus includes developing models for image classification, sentiment analysis, and 
            recommendation systems using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I have professional experience as a DevOps Intern at ST Engineering, where I implemented
            best practices to enhance collaboration between development and operations teams. I also
            worked at Accenture as a Test Analyst Intern and later as a Business Analyst, where I
            applied RPA techniques to automate software testing protocols.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I enjoy tackling complex problems and continuously learning new technologies. When I'm not
            coding you might find me gaming or hiking.
