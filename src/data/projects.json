I applied these foundations to figure drawing exercises, developing skills in capturing line of action, gesture, proportions, and anatomical landmarks. The curriculum culminated in compositional studies exploring balance, rhythm, pattern, and the effective use of the picture plane to convey specific ideas.\n\nThrough regular critique sessions and iterative development, I cultivated the ability to analyze visual communication critically and systematically improve execution.
